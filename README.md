### Analysis

- Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the tumor size better.
- There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, it is 0.84. As the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases too.
- The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
